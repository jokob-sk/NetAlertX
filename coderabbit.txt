Your assignment is as follows, examine each item and perform the following:
 1. Create a plan of action
 2. Execute your actions
 3. Run unit tests to validate
 4. After pass, mark complete
Use the provided fields.


Task #1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In `@server/api_server/schemas.py` around lines 151 - 157, The
DeviceListRequest.status field is missing the "offline" literal (and other
GraphQL-supported statuses), causing 422s; update the Literal in
DeviceListRequest.status to include "offline" (and optionally "my_devices",
"network_devices", "all_devices", or any other missing GraphQL statuses) and
adjust Field description accordingly, and modify
get_device_condition_by_status() to handle the "offline" case by returning the
condition devPresentLastScan=0 AND devIsArchived=0 (and map any newly added
status strings to their corresponding DB conditions) so REST validation and
backend filtering match GraphQL behavior.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
developer note: remove my_devices, all_devices, network_devices. they were added improperly.

Task #2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In `@server/api_server/api_server_start.py` around lines 1685 - 1690, The Flask
thread is started with debug=True which is unsafe in production; change the
app.run call in the thread lambda (the Thread creation around app.run(...)) to
derive the debug flag from the project's settings via get_setting_value (e.g.,
get_setting_value("FLASK_DEBUG", False)) instead of hard-coded True, and ensure
FLASK_DEBUG is added to the settings config with a default False for production.

Task #3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In `@test/api_endpoints/test_mcp_tools_endpoints.py` around lines 89 - 91, The
mock parameter names in test_get_open_ports_ip do not match the decorator order
(decorators apply bottom-up); swap or rename the parameters so the first mock
arg corresponds to the bottom decorator
("models.device_instance.get_temp_db_connection") and the second to the top
decorator ("models.plugin_object_instance.get_temp_db_connection") — e.g.,
change the signature to def test_get_open_ports_ip(mock_device_db_conn,
mock_plugin_db_conn, client, api_token): so names align with the patched
targets.

Task #4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In `@server/api_server/api_server_start.py` around lines 1685 - 1692, The call
to get_setting_value in the app.run lambda passes a second argument which will
raise TypeError because get_setting_value(key) accepts only one parameter;
change the lambda to call get_setting_value("FLASK_DEBUG") only and
coalesce/convert its result to a boolean (e.g., treat None/empty as False)
before passing it to app.run debug, so replace
debug=get_setting_value("FLASK_DEBUG", False) with debug using only
get_setting_value("FLASK_DEBUG") and a boolean fallback; update the app.run
lambda inside the Thread creation where app.run(...) is invoked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In `@server/api_server/schemas.py` around lines 414 - 417,
NetworkTopologyResponse defines the network connections field as edges but
DeviceInstance.getNetworkTopology() and tests return/validate links; update the
schema to match the implementation by renaming the field edges to links in the
NetworkTopologyResponse model (keep the Field default_factory and description
consistent), or alternatively change DeviceInstance.getNetworkTopology() and
related tests to return "edges" instead of "links" so both symbols
(NetworkTopologyResponse and DeviceInstance.getNetworkTopology) use the same
key.

Task #6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Modifying `server/db/db_helper.py` to add or document unsupported alias
statuses (e.g., `my_devices`, `all_devices`, `network_devices`) is not
allowed in this project. Any such suggestions have been removed from the
action list. If there is a valid, well-scoped change request for the device
status mapping, it should be opened as a dedicated issue and handled with
proper review; do not update `db_helper.py` in this change set.
