"""
Integration tests for the 'Device Down' event insertion and sleeping suppression.

Two complementary layers are tested:

Layer 1 — insert_events() (session_events.py)
  Non-sleeping devices (devCanSleep=0):
    The "Device Down" event fires when:
      devPresentLastScan = 1  (was online last scan)
      AND device NOT in CurrentScan  (absent this scan)
      AND devAlertDown != 0

  Sleeping devices (devCanSleep=1):
    The "Device Down" event is DEFERRED until the sleep window
    (NTFPRCS_sleep_time) expires.  During the sleep window the device
    is shown as "Sleeping" and NO down event is created.  After the
    window expires, insert_events creates the event via the
    sleep-expired query (devPresentLastScan=0, devIsSleeping=0).

Layer 2 — DevicesView down-count query (as used by insertOnlineHistory / db_helper)
  After presence is updated (devPresentLastScan → 0) the sleeping suppression
  (devIsSleeping=1) kicks in for count/API queries.
  Tests here verify that sleeping devices are excluded from down counts and that
  expired-window devices are included.
