NetAlertX is a network visibility and asset intelligence platform for homelabs, IT teams, MSPs, and distributed environments. It provides centralized network visibility and continuous asset discovery across remote sites, VLANs, branch offices, and segmented networks from a single interface.

NetAlertX gives you a real-time source of truth for connected devices, helps identify shadow IT and unauthorized hardware, supports compliance initiatives, and automates operational workflows across distributed customer environments.

Use NetAlertX to spot shadow IT, unauthorized hardware, IPAM drift, and other changes that matter to service teams. With multi-site sync, reporting, workflows, and webhooks, it helps MSPs stay ahead of problems without the overhead of a full NMS or SIEM.

## Quick Start

> [!WARNING]
> **Important:** If upgrading an older installation read the [Migration guide](https://docs.netalertx.com/MIGRATION/) for detailed instructions - it lists each migration scenario by version, so pick the one matching your installed version.

Start NetAlertX in seconds with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --network=host \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  -v /local_data_dir:/data \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  --tmpfs /tmp:uid=20211,gid=20211,mode=1700 \
  -e PORT=20211 \
  -e APP_CONF_OVERRIDE='{"GRAPHQL_PORT":"20214"}' \
  ghcr.io/netalertx/netalertx:latest
```

Note: Your `/local_data_dir` should contain a `config` and `db` folder.

To deploy a containerized instance directly from the source repository, execute the following BASH sequence:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/netalertx/NetAlertX.git
cd NetAlertX
docker compose up --force-recreate --build
# To customize: edit docker-compose.yaml and run that last command again
```

Need help configuring it? Check the [usage guide](https://docs.netalertx.com/README) or [full documentation](https://docs.netalertx.com/).

## Features

### Discovery & Asset Intelligence

Continuous monitoring for unauthorized asset discovery, connection state changes, and IP address management (IPAM) drift. Discovery & scan methods include: **arp-scan**,  **Pi-hole - DB import**,  **Pi-hole - DHCP leases import**, **Generic DHCP leases import**, **UNIFI controller import**, **SNMP-enabled router import**. Check the [Plugins](https://docs.netalertx.com/PLUGINS_OVERVIEW#readme) docs for a full list of avaliable plugins.

### Notification gateways

Send notifications to more than 80+ services, including Telegram via [Apprise](https://hub.docker.com/r/caronc/apprise), or use native [Pushsafer](https://www.pushsafer.com/), [Pushover](https://www.pushover.net/), or [NTFY](https://ntfy.sh/) publishers.

### Integrations and Plugins

Feed your data and device changes into [Home Assistant](https://docs.netalertx.com/HOME_ASSISTANT), read [API endpoints](https://docs.netalertx.com/API), or use [Webhooks](https://docs.netalertx.com/WEBHOOK_N8N) to setup custom automation flows. You can also
build your own scanners with the [Plugin system](https://docs.netalertx.com/PLUGINS_OVERVIEW#readme) in as little as [15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbxlwiWhv8).

### Workflows

The [workflows module](https://docs.netalertx.com/WORKFLOWS) automates IT governance by enforcing device categorization and cleanup policies. Whether you need to assign newly discovered devices to a specific Network Node, auto-group devices from a given vendor, unarchive a device if detected online, or automatically delete devices, this module provides the flexibility to tailor the automations to your needs.

### MSP & Multi-Site Monitoring

NetAlertX enables centralized monitoring across remote sites and isolated environments through Sync Nodes for VLANs and branch offices, providing unified visibility of assets across multiple networks. It supports [NOC-style wallboard dashboards](https://docs.netalertx.com/ADVISORY_EYES_ON_GLASS/), [Prometheus metrics export](https://docs.netalertx.com/API_METRICS/), workflow automation for device governance, and distributed discovery with centralized alerting for scalable network operations.

## Security & Privacy

NetAlertX scans your local network and can store metadata about connected devices. By default, all data is stored **locally**. No information is sent to external services unless you explicitly configure notifications or integrations.

Compliance & Hardening:
- Run it behind a reverse proxy with authentication
- Use firewalls to restrict access to the web UI
- Regularly update to the latest version for security patches
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via Reverse Proxy: Integrate with your existing SSO/Identity provider for secure dashboard access.

See [Security Best Practices](https://github.com/netalertx/NetAlertX/security) for more details.

## Designed for MSPs, NOCs & Distributed Networks

NetAlertX supports centralized monitoring across VLANs, branch offices, customer environments, isolated networks, and remote sites.

Using [Sync Nodes](https://docs.netalertx.com/ADVISORY_MULTI_SITE_MONITORING), distributed collectors securely send device inventory and network visibility data back to a central hub, enabling unified monitoring, alerting, and asset tracking across all locations.

This provides MSPs and NOCs with a single operational view of many independent networks, without requiring direct access or centralized scanning infrastructure.

Common deployments include MSP wallboards, NOC dashboards, multi-site inventory monitoring, and remote office discovery.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I monitor VLANs or remote subnets?**
A: Ensure the container has proper network access (e.g., use `--network host` on Linux). Also check that your scan method is properly configured in the UI.

**Q: What is the recommended deployment for high-availability?**
A: We recommend deploying via Docker with persistent volume mounts for database integrity and running behind a reverse proxy for secure access.

**Q: Will this send any data to the internet?**
A: No. All scans and data remain local, unless you set up cloud-based notifications.

**Q: Can I use this without Docker?**
A: You can install the application directly on your own hardware by following the [bare metal installation guide](https://docs.netalertx.com/HW_INSTALL).

**Q: Where is the data stored?**
A: In the `/data/config` and `/data/db` folders. Back up these folders regularly.


## Troubleshooting Tips

- Some scanners (e.g. ARP) may not detect devices on different subnets. See the [Remote networks guide](https://docs.netalertx.com/REMOTE_NETWORKS) for workarounds.
- Wi-Fi-only networks may require alternate scanners for accurate detection.
- Notification throttling may be needed for large networks to prevent spam.
- On some systems, elevated permissions (like `CAP_NET_RAW`) may be needed for low-level scanning.

Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/netalertx/NetAlertX/issues) for the latest bug reports and solutions and consult [the official documentation](https://docs.netalertx.com/).
