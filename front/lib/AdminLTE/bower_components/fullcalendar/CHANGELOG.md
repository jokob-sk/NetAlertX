--------------------

POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGE:

- background event background color does not completely fill cells in Chrome (#4145)
- provide a delta for eventResize when resizing from start (#4135)

v2.1.0 (2014-08-25)
-------------------

Large code refactor with better OOP, better code reuse, and more comments.
**No more reliance on jQuery UI** for event dragging, resizing, or anything else.

Significant changes to HTML/CSS skeleton:
- Leverages tables for liquid rendering of days and events. No costly manual repositioning ([809])
- **Backwards-incompatibilities**:
	- **Many classNames have changed. Custom CSS will likely need to be adjusted.**
	- IE7 definitely not supported anymore
	- In `eventRender` callback, `element` will not be attached to DOM yet
	- Events are styled to be one line by default ([1992]). Can be undone through custom CSS,
	  but not recommended (might get gaps [like this][111] in certain situations).

A "more..." link when there are too many events on a day ([304]). Works with month and basic views
as well as the all-day section of the agenda views. New options:
- `eventLimit`. a number or `true`
- `eventLimitClick`. the `"popover`" value will reveal all events in a raised panel (the default)
- `eventLimitText`
- `dayPopoverFormat`

Changes related to height and scrollbars:
- `aspectRatio`/`height`/`contentHeight` values will be honored *no matter what*
	- If too many events causing too much vertical space, scrollbars will be used ([728]).
	  This is default behavior for month view (**backwards-incompatibility**)
	- If too few slots in agenda view, view will stretch to be the correct height ([2196])
- `'auto'` value for `height`/`contentHeight` options. If content is too tall, the view will
  vertically stretch to accomodate and no scrollbars will be used ([521]).
- Tall weeks in month view will borrow height from other weeks ([243])
- Automatically scroll the view then dragging/resizing an event ([1025], [2078])
- New `fixedWeekCount` option to determines the number of weeks in month view
	- Supersedes `weekMode` (**deprecated**). Instead, use a combination of `fixedWeekCount` and
	  one of the height options, possibly with an `'auto'` value

Much nicer, glitch-free rendering of calendar *for printers* ([35]). Things you might not expect:
- Buttons will become hidden
- Agenda views display a flat list of events where the time slots would be

Other issues resolved along the way:
- Space on right side of agenda events configurable through CSS ([204])
- Problem with window resize ([259])
- Events sorting stays consistent across weeks ([510])
- Agenda's columns misaligned on wide screens ([511])
- Run `selectHelper` through `eventRender` callbacks ([629])
- Keyboard access, tabbing ([637])
- Run resizing events through `eventRender` ([714])
- Resize an event to a different day in agenda views ([736])
- Allow selection across days in agenda views ([778])
- Mouseenter delegated event not working on event elements ([936])
- Agenda event dragging, snapping to different columns is erratic ([1101])
- Android browser cuts off Day view at 8 PM with no scroll bar ([1203])
- Don't fire `eventMouseover`/`eventMouseout` while dragging/resizing ([1297])
- Customize the resize handle text ("=") ([1326])
- If agenda event is too short, don't overwrite `.fc-event-time` ([1700])
- Zooming calendar causes events to misalign ([1996])
- Event destroy callback on event removal ([2017])
- Agenda views, when RTL, should have axis on right ([2132])
- Make header buttons more accessibile ([2151])
- daySelectionMousedown should interpret OSX ctrl+click as a right mouse click ([2169])
- Best way to display time text on multi-day events *with times* ([2172])
- Eliminate table use for header layout ([2186])
- Event delegation used for event-related callbacks (like `eventClick`). Speedier.

-------------------

Internationalization support, timezone support, and [MomentJS] integration. Extensive changes, many
of which are backwards incompatible.

[Full list of changes][Upgrading-to-v2] | [Affected Issues][Date-Milestone]

An automated testing framework has been set up ([Karma] + [Jasmine]) and tests have been written
which cover about half of FullCalendar's functionality. Special thanks to @incre-d, @vidbina, and
@sirrocco for the help.

In addition, the main development repo has been repurposed to also include the built distributable
JS/CSS for the project and will serve as the new [Bower] endpoint.

v1.5 (2011-03-19)
-----------------

- slicker default styling for buttons
- reworked a lot of the calendar's HTML and accompanying CSS (solves [327] and [395])
- more printer-friendly (fullcalendar-print.css)
- fullcalendar now inherits styles from jquery-ui themes differently.
  styles for buttons are distinct from styles for calendar cells.
  (solves [299])
- can now color events through FullCalendar options and Event-Object properties ([117])
  THIS IS NOW THE PREFERRED METHOD OF COLORING EVENTS (as opposed to using className and CSS)
	- FullCalendar options:
		- eventColor (changes both background and border)
		- eventBackgroundColor
		- eventBorderColor
		- eventTextColor
	- Event-Object options:
		- color (changes both background and border)
		- backgroundColor
		- borderColor
		- textColor
- can now specify an event source as an *object* with a `url` property (json feed) or
  an `events` property (function or array) with additional properties that will
  be applied to the entire event source:
	- color (changes both background and border)
	- backgroudColor
	- borderColor
	- textColor
	- className
	- editable
	- allDayDefault
	- ignoreTimezone
	- startParam (for a feed)
	- endParam   (for a feed)
	- ANY OF THE JQUERY $.ajax OPTIONS
	  allows for easily changing from GET to POST and sending additional parameters ([386])
	  allows for easily attaching ajax handlers such as `error` ([754])
	  allows for turning caching on ([355])
- Google Calendar feeds are now specified differently:
	- specify a simple string of your feed's URL
	- specify an *object* with a `url` property of your feed's URL.
	  you can include any of the new Event-Source options in this object.
	- the old `$.fullCalendar.gcalFeed` method still works
- no more IE7 SSL popup ([504])
- remove `cacheParam` - use json event source `cache` option instead
- latest jquery/jquery-ui
