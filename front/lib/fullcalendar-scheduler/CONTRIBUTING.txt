## Reporting Bugs

Each bug report MUST have a [Codepen/JSFiddle] recreation before any work can begin. [further instructions &raquo;](http://fullcalendar.io/wiki/Reporting-Bugs/)


## Requesting Features

Please search the [Issue Tracker] to see if your feature has already been requested, and if so, subscribe to it. Otherwise, read these [further instructions &raquo;](http://fullcalendar.io/wiki/Requesting-Features/)


## Contributing Features

Each new feature should be designed as robustly as possible and be useful beyond the immediate usecase it was initially designed for. Feel free to start a ticket discussing the feature's specs before coding.


## Contributing Bugfixes

In the description of your [Pull Request][Using Pull Requests], please include recreation steps for the bug as well as a [JSFiddle/JSBin] demo. Communicating the buggy behavior is a requirement before a merge can happen.
