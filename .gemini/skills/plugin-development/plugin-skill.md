# Plugin Development

## Expected Workflow

1. Read this skill and `docs/PLUGINS_DEV.md` for full context.
2. Find or create the plugin in `server/plugins/<code_name>/`.
3. Read the plugin's `config.json` and `script.py` to understand its functionality.
4. Run: `python3 server/plugins/<code_name>/script.py`
5. Retrieve the result from `/tmp/log/plugins/last_result.<PREF>.log` quickly — the backend deletes it after processing.

## Run a Plugin Manually

```bash
python3 server/plugins/<code_name>/script.py
```

Ensure `sys.path` includes `/app/server/plugins` and `/app/server` (as in the template).

## Plugin Structure

```text
server/plugins/<code_name>/
├── config.json      # Manifest with settings
├── script.py        # Main script
└── ...
```

## Plugin Prefix Rules

- Uppercase letters only (no underscores, no numbers)
- Must be unique across all plugins
- Short but readable (e.g., `ARPSCAN`, `MQTT`, `UNIFI`)

## Settings Pattern

- `<PREF>_RUN`: execution phase
- `<PREF>_RUN_SCHD`: cron-like schedule
- `<PREF>_CMD`: script path
- `<PREF>_RUN_TIMEOUT`: timeout in seconds — **this is enforced by the core plugin runner as the whole script's kill-timeout** (`server/plugin.py` passes it straight to `subprocess(..., timeout=...)`). It is not a safe per-HTTP-call timeout — don't reuse it for individual network calls in a loop, or one slow call can burn the whole budget and get the process killed before it writes its result file.
- `<PREF>_WATCH`: columns to watch for changes
- `<PREF>_IMPORT_ON`: optional — gates whether this run's rows get promoted into `CurrentScan` (only relevant if `mapped_to_table: "CurrentScan"`). See `docs/PLUGINS_IMPORT_BEHAVIOR.md` for the related per-row `scanCreatesDevice`/`scanNotificationMode`/`scanPresence` columns.
- **`dataType` and `default_value` must agree.** `dataType: "array"`/`"object"` needs a real JSON literal for `default_value` (`'["default"]'`), not a bare string (`"default"`). `setting_value_to_python_type()` (`server/helper.py`) `json.loads()`s the default at runtime; a bare string fails silently — logged, and `[]` is returned instead of your default (e.g. `devParentRelType`, `UI_theme`, `UI_TOPOLOGY_ORDER`). If `elementOptions` already sets `multiple`/`orderable: "false"`, the setting is scalar — use `dataType: "string"` instead.

## Data Contract

Scripts write to `/tmp/log/plugins/last_result.<PREF>.log` using `plugin_helper.py`:

```python
from plugin_helper import Plugin_Objects

plugin_objects = Plugin_Objects()
plugin_objects.add_object(...)  # During processing
plugin_objects.write_result_file()  # Exactly once at end
```

**Important:** The backend processes and deletes the result file almost immediately. Retrieve it quickly if inspecting output.

Every mapped field (`objectPrimaryId`/`objectSecondaryId`/`watchedValue1-4`/`extra`/`helpVal1-4`) is HTML/control-char-stripped by default before it's persisted: plugin output is untrusted (network responses, device-reported names, etc.). `foreignKey` is always sanitized too, unconditionally. Only opt a column out (`"allow_raw_text": true`) if it's a display-only type (`textarea_readonly`); see `docs/PLUGINS_DEV.md#field-sanitization`.

## Execution Phases

| Phase | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `once` | Once at startup |
| `schedule` | On cron schedule |
| `always_after_scan` | After every scan |
| `before_name_updates` | Before name resolution |
| `on_new_device` | When new device detected |
| `on_notification` | When notification triggered |

## `all_plugins` Caching

`all_plugins` is loaded once (`initialise.py`'s `get_plugins_configs()`) and reused as the same object until a reload - but `update_api()` (`server/api.py`), which takes it as a parameter, runs on every scan cycle and plugin completion, not just on reload.

- If you write a function that derives something from `all_plugins` and gets called from `update_api()` or another frequent call site, cache the result instead of recomputing every call - retain a reference to the last-seen `all_plugins` list and compare it to the current one with `is`, not by `id(all_plugins)` alone (once the old list is garbage collected, Python can reuse that id for an unrelated object, wrongly serving a stale cached result for what is actually a new reload)
- Pattern: `server/db/plugin_field_views.py`'s `get_all_device_field_views()`

## Plugin Formats

| Format | Purpose | Phase |
|--------|---------|-------|
| publisher | Send notifications | `on_notification` |
| dev scanner | Create/manage devices | `schedule` |
| name discovery | Discover device names | `before_name_updates` |
| importer | Import from services | `schedule` |
| system | Core functionality | `schedule` |

## Before Opening a PR

Check the plugin against the [Conventions Checklist](../../../docs/PLUGINS_DEV.md#conventions-checklist) in `docs/PLUGINS_DEV.md` — `RUN` default, schedule precedent, `RUN_TIMEOUT` semantics, reusing core settings, description length, the multi-instance settings pattern, `allow_raw_text` restricted to display-only column types, and `scanSourcePlugin`'s static value matching `unique_prefix` exactly. Most plugin PR review comments trace back to one of these.

If the plugin needs a new system package or Python dependency, mirroring it into the root `Dockerfile`/`requirements.txt` alone is not enough: see the Conventions Checklist's build-target-mirroring bullet for `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` (regenerate via `.devcontainer/scripts/generate-configs.sh`, don't hand-edit it), `Dockerfile.debian`, and `install/ubuntu24`/`install/proxmox`'s own `requirements.txt` files.

## Starting Point

Copy from `server/plugins/__template` and customize. Read `docs/PLUGINS_DEV.md` for the full development guide.
