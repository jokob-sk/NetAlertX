"""
Local password authentication provider.

Validates the incoming password by comparing its SHA-256 digest against the
hash stored in the ``SETPWD_password`` setting — the same value that the PHP
login page checks.  This provider is always available as a fallback regardless
of whether LDAP is enabled.

Password handling
-----------------
- The stored value is the hex-encoded SHA-256 digest of the *raw* password.
- Comparison uses :func:`hmac.compare_digest` to prevent timing attacks,
  matching PHP's ``hash_equals`` behaviour.
- No username check is performed for the local provider — any non-empty
  username is accepted (backward-compatible with the single-user model).
