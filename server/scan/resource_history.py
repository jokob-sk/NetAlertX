resource_history.py - tick-scoped resource sampling and persistence.

Called from __main__.py at the top and bottom of the schedule-tick block, so
its window covers run_plugin_scripts("schedule")/process_scan() together -
the two calls that actually cost CPU/IO each cycle. Pure, stateless psutil
reads - safe to call from a fresh Process() each time, no shared state with
health_endpoint.py's live /health gauge at all (see health_endpoint.py).

    standalone live value. Includes children_user/children_system so a
    scanning plugin's own subprocess CPU time (reaped into the parent's
    cpu_times() by the kernel) is captured - io_counters() has no equivalent
    children field, so IO here only ever reflects NetAlertX's own direct I/O,
    never a plugin subprocess's.

    Defensive: some container security profiles (custom seccomp, restricted
    runtimes) can make io_counters()/cpu_times() raise psutil.AccessDenied or
    AttributeError - sampling must never be able to break the actual scan
    tick, so failures fall back to zeros rather than propagating.
